{"name":"React-tailwind","tagline":"React with Tailwind CSS - A Starter kit to develop React.js projects quickly with Create React App and Tailwind CSS framework.","body":"# ðŸš€ React with Tailwind CSS\r\n\r\nLearn how to quickly set up a React project with the Tailwind CSS framework using the [starter kit](https://github.com/labnol/react-tailwind). The project was bootstrapped with Create React App and it uses PurgeCSS to remove all the unused CSS classes from the production build.\r\n\r\n## Live Demo\r\n\r\n[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/labnol/react-tailwind) | [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/react-tailwindcss) | [Vercel](https://csb-ggfl7-ipit3clvr.vercel.app/)\r\n\r\n### Available npm scripts\r\n\r\nIn the project directory, you can run:\r\n\r\n### `npm run start`\r\n\r\nRuns the app in the development mode.\r\n\r\nOpen `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.\r\n\r\nThe page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.\r\n\r\n### `npm run build`\r\n\r\nBuilds the React app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\r\n\r\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!\r\n\r\n### `npm run inline`\r\n\r\nThis command uses `Gulp` to inline all the JavaScript and CSS files from the production build into a single minified file.\r\n\r\n### ðŸ“§ Contact\r\n\r\nThe React and Tailwind CSS starter is written by [Amit Agarwal](https://www.labnol.org/about).\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or feedback, send an email at [amit@labnol.org](mailto:amit@labnol.org?subject=Tailwind+React).\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
